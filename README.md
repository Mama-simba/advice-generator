### What I learned

I learned how to fetch the Advice Slip API in order to show different advices randomly. In order to do that, I used the fetch method but I have also played around with the axios library. Feel free to explore whatever is best/easier for you.
I have created a tutorial explaining the differences between fetch and axios. Check it out [here!](https://www.cristina-padilla.com/apicalls.html).
